# Automated_News_Classification_System_Using_NLP

## Description:

This project aims to automatically classify news articles from various sources into predefined topics using an efficient and user-friendly approach. By leveraging powerful natural language processing (NLP) techniques and well-structured code, we strive to:

* **Automate Topic Identification**: Eliminate manual tagging tasks by developing a robust classification model to accurately assign article topics.
* **Leverage Diverse Data Sources**: Utilize news websites like BBC, The Hindu, Times Now, CNN, and others to create a rich and informative dataset.
* **Emphasize Code Readability and Maintainability**: Employ clear naming conventions, comments, and modularity for easy understanding and potential collaboration.
* **Offer Streamlit Deployment**: Provide a straightforward way to interact with the trained model through a user-friendly web application.
  
## Key Steps:

1. **Web Scraping**:

* **Tools**: Consider ethical, responsible scraping practices using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Selenium.
* **Focus**: Extract titles, content, and metadata (e.g., publication date, source) ensuring topic diversity.

  
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:

* **Cleaning**: Remove HTML tags, ads, non-text content, and unnecessary characters.
* **Tokenization**: Split text into words or subwords (words, parts of speech, lemmas, etc.).
* **Stopword Removal**: Filter out common stopwords (the, a, etc.) that don't add significant meaning.
* **Text Normalization**: Consider lemmatization or stemming to reduce words to base forms.
* **Missing Data Handling**: Address missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
* **Formatting**: Ensure consistent format across all articles.

  
3. **Text Representation**:

* **Techniques**: Explore TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or more advanced methods based on the dataset's size and complexity.
* **Evaluation**: Consider evaluating representation methods on downstream tasks for optimal choice.

4. **Topic Clustering**:

* **Algorithms**: Experiment with K-means, hierarchical clustering, topic modeling (LDA, NMF), or community detection algorithms depending on data characteristics.
* **Number of Clusters**: Determine the optimal number of clusters based on domain knowledge, interpretability needs, and evaluation metrics (e.g., silhouette score).
* **Evaluation**: Use metrics like silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or topic coherence to assess cluster quality.

5.**Classification Model**:

* **Models**: Consider Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, or deep learning models like LSTMs or BERTs based on data size and complexity.
* **Training**: Split data into training and testing sets. Ensure balanced representation of topics in training data. Train the model with labeled clusters as ground truth.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to improve model performance.
* **Evaluation**: Assess performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.
* **Documentation**: Document model selection, training setup, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics.

6. **Deployment**:

* **Streamlit Application**: Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to allow users to input news articles and receive predicted topics.
* **Deployment options**: Explore cloud platforms like Heroku or Vercel or render for hosting the application.

## Conclusion:

This comprehensive project delivers a robust and versatile News Topic Classification framework. By incorporating diverse data sources, advanced NLP techniques, and flexible deployment via Streamlit, it offers valuable insights into news content and simplifies topic identification. However, continued research and evaluation can further enhance its accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to new domains.
